### Too Long; Didn't Read - 
Because i've always wanted to have a personal blog, so that one day I could become a renowned published author, build a network and influence the whole world in such a way that I end up conquering it ultimately! And that I was bored too.

### Too Long; Did Read - 
Okay, honestly typing, I was bored and I thought it would be really cool to have a personal blog, so that I could finally put all the weird stuff I always think of at one place and organise it in a proper way to see if it makes any sense to any sane person.

So far so good!

Having said that, god knows it's extremely hard for me to properly structure my thoughts and write them down without digressing into endless discussions with myself over how really should I digress in this sentence to make the point and not make the point as well because I've to digress. Wait, is that a paradox? Anyway I think you've got the point already. So, it's something I would want to become good at.

Plus, I came across this thought-provoking and fascinating blog **[WaitButWhy]** (WBW)[^wbw]. If you want to know more and read about yourself then you should probably check *[this]* post out. Author of WBW generally does in-depth analysis of his own thoughts and somehow manages to write them down clearly which ultimately gives him a clearer picture than what he initially started with. Again, it's something I would want to master and apply at many places.

# Why the name 'theoddblog'?[^tob]
If you have already started smelling something peculiar about this blog, then you got the answer right there. 
If not, then what's up bro! Seems like you are just the right person I would like to share my bizarre insane shit ever written with. Well.. that should do it.
But for just in case situations, let me present this dude just for you! Take your time to acknowledge his beauty and accept the fact that we'll never be as cool as him.

Still not convinced? Let me know in the comments below and I'll get you some help as soon as I get a GF.

BTW coming up with a good domain name is no easy task. You should reach out to your friends and family to get some valuable suggestions like 'youcantwriteasshole.com', 'stopwastingmytime.com' etc.

# How to put up a similar blog?
Pretty simple! Just follow this guide and in no time you can have a fully functional blog up and running for free!

Things you need:-

 * Domain Name

	Getting a domain is the easiest of all, once you've finalised the name, check for it's availability and purchase the domain name from sites like [GoDaddy], [BigRock] etc. Cost of a domain depends upon its name but ideally you can get them for as cheap as 200Rs for a year. Later you'd have to associate this domain name with the IP address of your hosting server(2nd point).
 * Web Hosting

	You don't really have to put in any money upto 1 year thanks to [Amazon AWS Free Tier]. After creating an account, boot up a t2.micro EC2 server up and voila!
 * [Jekyll]
	
	Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.

	There is a pretty good [quick-start guide] already written, so why reinvent the wheel. Just follow it and have your own personal blog to play around with. :+1:
